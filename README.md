<H1> Matlab programs for generating point clouds for interpolation in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces </H1>

These are Matlab programs for generating point clouds for interpolation in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. 
These programs are used to yield the results of the numerical experiments in the article

"Generation of point clouds by convex optimization for interpolation in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces" (arXiv:).

As written below, the programs with the prefix "SOCP_" are based on the second-order cone programming problems, which are proposed in the above article. Those with the profix "P_greedy_" are programs that yield points by the P-greedy algorithm. We used them for comparing the P-greedy algorithm with the proposed methods in the article. 

Below are the descriptions of the program files.
