<H1> Matlab programs for generating point clouds for interpolation in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces </H1>

These are Matlab programs for generating point clouds for interpolation in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces 
by second order cone programming. These programs are used to yield the results of the numerical experiments in the article

"Generation of point clouds by convex optimization for interpolation in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces" (arXiv:),
