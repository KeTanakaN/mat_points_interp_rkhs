<H1> Matlab programs for generating point clouds for interpolation in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces </H1>

These are Matlab programs for generating point clouds for interpolation in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. 
These programs are used to yield the results of the numerical experiments in the article

"Generation of point clouds by convex optimization for interpolation in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces" (arXiv:).

As written below, the programs with the prefix "SOCP_" are based on the second order cone programming problems, which are proposed in the above article.
